# ESP8266 Gameboy Dev Board

Your go to dev board for Gameboy accessories development. Put it on top of Wemos D1 mini and have fun.

## Pinout

This board uses the following pins:

D0, D1, D2, D3 (Pull GPIO0 to ground), D4, D8

Hence **IT IS** compatible with Wemos SD card shield. I've remapped conflicting pins as following:

* D5 -> D4
* D6 -> D0
* D7 -> D8

## Part List

The part list is included as a Digikey shopping cart. Quantities are for one (1) board.

Note that EXT PORT AGB connector **is not included**. It must be sourced elsewhere.
